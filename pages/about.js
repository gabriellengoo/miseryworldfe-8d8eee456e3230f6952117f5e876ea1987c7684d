We strive to cultivate generative ecologies of connection, care and solidarity that can support and sustain the collective healing and resilience of our community. we know first hand that healing and liberation is interwoven and by nurturing community care and addressing collective trauma, we seek to disrupt the growing privatisation of healing and the “self-care industrial complex”. 
we work for and with lived experience leaders to co-create accessible, playful, and transformative peer-led healing spaces, services and resources by (un)archiving and (re)generating the vast wisdom, community resilience strategies and potential for joy that are abundant amongst our people.

      The work of creating communities of care is not new, nor invented by us. it is ancient work that exists within communities, cultures and species around the world. we continue the legacies and lineages of our ancestors and the artists, activists and community workers that have come before us and those around the world that are committed to this work.

      We are inspired by our friends and lovers, the creative power of our communities and the mistakes of our parents. we give thanks and draw strength from the disability and healing justice movements, black feminist theory and praxis, mad studies, queer of colour critique, radical transfeminists, our dyke, faggot and gender divine sibings worldwide, femmes of colour spaces, wxtchcraft, raving on the dancefloor, community-based transformative justice interventions, indigenous herbalists, generative somatics, revolutionary mothering, nurses, sex workers, teachers, survivors, carers, youth workers and black, brown, indigenous and diasporic spiritual traditions.

      We have learnt that people are the experts in their own lives and believe that everyone should have the right to fail and the support they need to grow. we acknowledge that harm is an integral part of the human experience and that experiencing harm is one of the many ways our lives, minds, and hearts adapt to the world.

      Our work is rooted in the principles of healing centered harm reduction including trauma-informed care, agency, collaboration, intersectionality, consent and acknowledges the historical and on-going social, cultural, environmental and economic systems that constantly terrorise our communities including experiences of colonisation, anti-blackness and racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, ableism and other oppressions.

 Worlds that are safer, happier, healthier and more peaceful. worlds where we all work to acknowledge and minimise our own potential for intimate, interpersonal, structural and ecological violence and in doing so resolve conflict compassionately.

 <p  className='z-40 p-5 '>
 Worlds where people before profits, harm-reduction and post traumatic growth is the norm. where we are all supported in alchemising our pain through play, consent, connection, boundaries and rest. worlds where you can cry and be held, if you want to.
